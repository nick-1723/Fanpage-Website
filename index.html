                    <p> The purpose of this fanpage is to illustrate the good influences and the examples that the music industry leaves behind. The stereo type that the HipHop & rap industry glorify drugs, money, and sex is biased and untrue. Music is a way for one to express their emotions through a form of music just like painters and writers. These singers and rappers do their job in such a way that is their own and unique to the way they rap/sing. The good thing that people seem to forget, without thinking about it, is how they use music is used at an escape frim someone's troubles. A majority of artists know that their music has power and thy use it in a positive and respectable way while still being true themselves. </p>

                <h2><div>Reasons why positive music is needed:</div></h2>
                <p>Chicago is a city that is currently known for its rapid death. Rappers like Chance The Rapper, Vic Mensa, Kanye, Lupe Fiasco and many more have a positive messages if you pay attention. If you listen closely to their lyrics, these rappers hold onto their Chicago roots proudly and use it in a beneficial way. Cities with a high murder count tend to be the cities with the most powerful music such a Kendrick Lamar, from Compton Ca, Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G, and many other famous well known rappers. But in those tough impoverished cities and neighborhoods create the music that we all know today as trap and drill music that promotes drugs, money, and sex. This typically leads into the stereotype that all rap music is the same when that has very little to do with it. Artists express and reflect on their lives whether that be through telling stories or glorifying things they do or have done. However, positive music is making an impact when well known artists understand their words are powerful and begin to use it in a powerful way that changes the outlook that the youth.
